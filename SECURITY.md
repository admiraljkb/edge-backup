## Reporting a Vulnerability

Open an issue and flag appropriately.  The potential for remote security issues on this are very limited, but local issues are possible of course.

Updates on a reported issue would be within 48 hours.  If accepted, a workaround/resolution would be provided within 2 weeks in normal circumstances.  If it takes longer further communications would be forthcoming.

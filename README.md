AutoIT3 Windows Utility to backup your Garmin Edge based product.

This script is in AutoIT3, version v3.3.14.5.  Downloadable here:  https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/ 


I created this because Garmin 1030 units seem to need a lot of hard resets, reconfiguring them is quite a pain, and so is manually backing up.  

* Garmin - this util only took me roughly 4 hours.  Why couldn't y'all do it?  XOXO and all, but c'mon guys.  :)
* Used info provided from Garmin Support here: https://support.garmin.com/en-MY/?faq=eWswdSH4aC3xrXxmQj7U9A

* Add'l credit where credit is due - Used the following two sample scripts as the base which turned this into childs play:

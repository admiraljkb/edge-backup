# edge-backup

AutoIT3 Windows Utility to backup your Garmin Edge based product.

This script is in AutoIT3, version v3.3.14.5 (also works with 3.3.15.3 beta).  Downloadable here:  <https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/>

(rough instructions follow)

Instructions:

* Option 1 - To simply run, pull this repo down local, and then right click on `Run Script`.  (have to have AutoIT3 installed)
* Option 2 - Download the already compiled EXE from the [release page](https://github.com/admiraljkb/edge-backup/releases).  The EXE is standalone and doesn't require anything else installed.

I created this because Garmin 1030 units seem to need a lot of hard resets, reconfiguring them is quite a pain, and so is manually backing up.  

* Garmin - this util only took me roughly 4 hours.  Why couldn't y'all do it?  XOXO and all, but c'mon guys.  :)
* Used info provided from Garmin Support here: <https://support.garmin.com/en-MY/?faq=eWswdSH4aC3xrXxmQj7U9A>

* Add'l credit where credit is due - Used the following two sample scripts as the base which turned this into childs play:
